Reading is fun, from reading news headlines to reading Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime & Punishment. I have been a Fanatical reader. 
While reading I often come across some words that baffle me, So I note them down in my notes library to later search for their meaning.
I have collected more than 300 words as of now which were new to me and I would like to get their meaning.
This could have been a tedious task, so for help I called Python who then arranged my meeting with selenium.

This script is easy to use. It takes a file as input which contains words and then returns another files with words & their meaning.

Installion:
1. Just run the .bat file & you're all done.
