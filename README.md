Background:

Reading is fun, from reading news headlines to reading Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime & Punishment. I have been a Fanatical reader. While reading I often come across some words that baffle me, So I note them down in my noteâ€™s library to later search for their meaning. I have collected more than 300 words as of now which were new to me and I would like to get their meaning. This could have been a tedious task, so for help I called Python who then arranged my meeting with selenium.
This script is easy to use. It takes a file as input which contains words and then returns another file with words & their meaning.
Installation
1.	 Just run the .bat file & you're all done.
